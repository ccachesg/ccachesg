- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the intersections with our secure file sharing/digital evidence management and blockchain technologies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Southern cooking
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which bring publicly-available, but hard-to-get-to information to light.
- 📫 How to reach me. Here works.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him/hey you
- ⚡ Fun fact: If I had to do it all over again, I'd be a chef in Key West.
